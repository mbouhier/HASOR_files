# HASOR - OpenRTI Arduino and Hardware Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Arduino code and hardware design files related to the HASOR - OpenRTI device. This repository contains the necessary files for programming the Arduino, 3D printing components using STL files, and laser cutting using vector files.

## Arduino Code

The `/arduino sketch` directory contains the Arduino code for the HASOR - OpenRTI device. This code is responsible for controlling and coordinating the various functions and features of the device. Follow the instructions below to upload the code to your Arduino:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Navigate to File > Open and select the `controleur_arduino_hasor` directory previously copied on your computer.
3. Connect your Arduino mega board to your computer.
4. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Click the "Upload" button to transfer the code to the Arduino.

## 3D Printed Parts (STL Files)

The `/3D printing` directory houses the STL files for the 3D-printed components of the HASOR - OpenRTI device. These files are ready for use with your 3D printer. Feel free to customize the printing parameters based on your specific 3D printer and material. Please check the HASOR - OpenRTI device website for details about printing parameters.

## Laser Cutting (Vector Files)

In the `/laser cutting` directory, you'll find vector files for laser cutting the parts of the HASOR - OpenRTI device. Drawing are done for 3mm thick material. These files are provided in a format compatible with your preferred laser cutting software. Ensure that you adjust the settings such as  cutting and engraving power according to your laser cutter specifications.
